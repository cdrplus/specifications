                 DataRight+ Security Profile: Baseline
          draft-authors-datarightplus-infosec-baseline-latest

Abstract

   The DataRight+ Security Profile: Baseline is intended to be a
   compatible profile of the [CDS] presented as a profile of
   [FAPI-1.0-Advanced].  This profile focuses primarily on the
   obligations between Provider and Initiator with respect to
   authorisation requests and does so as an overlay on the underlying
   FAPI profile combined with the inclusion of specified authorisation
   types.

   This profile does not attempt to provide elaboration on registration
   protocols, certificate profiles, federation or other components
   specified within the [CDS].  Further terminology used is deliberately
   jurisdiction agnostic, please refer to [DATARIGHTPLUS-ROSETTA] for
   specific ecosystem mappings.

1.  Scope

   This document specifies methods for the following:

   *  method of obtaining OAuth2 tokens as originally described within
      the [CDS] and;
   *  requirements related to participants for initiating authorisations
      and obtaining ongoing authorisation credentials

   This document does not seek to:

   *  specify correlation elements between technical and the legal
      obligations contained within documents such as the CDR Rules;
   *  restate unchanged requirements from upstream specifications
   *  consider historical obligations which have expired

2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the term "JSON Web Token (JWT)" as defined by
   [JWT] and the terms "Consumer", "Ecosystem Authority", "Initiator",
   "Personally Identifiable Information (PII)", "Provider", "User" as
   defined by [DATARIGHTPLUS-ROSETTA].

   The specification also defines the following terms:

   Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID)  Identifier that identifies
      the Consumer to a Initiator that cannot be correlated with the
      Consumer's PPID at another Initiator.
   User Identifier  A User Identifier is a unique piece of information,
      typically a username, which identifies the User

3.  Provider

3.1.  Authorisation Server

   The authorisation server SHALL support the provisions specified in

   3.  Section 5.2.2-11: SHALL support the pushed authorization request
       endpoint as described in PAR;
   4.  Section 5.2.2-14: SHALL authenticate the confidential client

3.1.1.  Authorisation Flow

       relationship between the user and the Consumer;
   2.  SHALL request a User Identifier already known by the User;
   3.  SHALL use a one-time password (OTP) provided to the Consumer
       through an existing channel or mechanism;

4.2.  Resource Server

   The resource server SHALL support the provisions specified in clause
   6.2.2 of [FAPI-1.0-Baseline] with the following sections replaced:

   1.  Section 6.2.2-3: SHALL send the last time the customer logged
       into the client in the x-fapi-auth-date header where the value is

5.  TLS Considerations

   Section 8.5 of [FAPI-1.0-Advanced] SHALL apply.

   In addition:

   1.  Use of Mutual TLS is REQUIRED at all Authenticated Resource
       Server endpoints except where required for Discovery or Consumer
       browser access (ie.  Authorisation endpoint);
   2.  All parties SHALL apply the certificate management policy
       requirements of the relevant Ecosystem Authority

6.  Implementation Considerations

   Claims available via the profile scope will only return the details
   of the User which may be different to the Consumer.

   Providers SHOULD explicitly capture Claims requested by the
   Initiator.  If the data cluster or [OIDC] profile scope changes
   meaning in future this ensures the Provider only returns what the
   Consumer initially authorised to disclose.

   Initiators SHOULD record the following information each time an
   authorisation flow is executed:

   *  User Identifier;
   *  timestamp;
   *  IP;
   *  scopes;
   *  duration
